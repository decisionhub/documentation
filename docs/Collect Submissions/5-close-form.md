# Step 5: Manage Applicant Access

## About manage applicant access

After you have published a form, you have a few settings that are important to you! After you publish the form, there will be a **Manage Applicant Access** button which when clicked, will open a popup with a few settings to configure.

## Close form

The first thing you may be wondering after publishing the form is... how do I close the form? The **Manage Applicant Access** popup is exactly how you do that. There are two options for closing the form:

1. Manually close the form
2. Schedule a time for the form to close

### Manually close the form

You can manually come back to the form at a later date and close the form, effective immediately. Anyone who is actively filling out the form at the moment of closing will not be able to submit their application. Only submissions already submitted at the time of closing will be considered for review.

### Schedule a time for the form to close

Enter a date and time for the form to close. Once that time is hit, the form is closed. Anyone who is actively filling out the form at the moment of closing will not be able to submit their application. Only submissions already submitted at the scheduled time of closing will be considered for review.

## Reopening a closed form

There is a chance you close the form but then later realize you want to reopen it. No problem! The **Manage Applicant Access** popup handles this too. After closing the form, reopen the popup and click the **Reopen Form Now** button.

Notes:

1. Reopening the form will generate a new unique link for the applicant. The old link will still remaing as "closed".
2. Re-embed or share the new link with the applicants you wish to continue to apply after the initial close date.
3. This allows you to make one off exceptions if an applicant had a valid reason to miss the initially set deadline.

## Allow editting of submitted applications

The default behaviour of DecisionHub's applicant portal is once they apply, they are unable to go back and edit their submission. However this is configurable from the **Manage Applicant Access** popup. If you wish to allow the applicants to edit their submission after submission (but before the time the form is closed) you can click the **Allow** button in the popup. If you change your mind, you can click the **Disallow** button which only appears after **Allow** is clicked.
