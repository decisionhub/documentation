# Working with questions

## About form questions

Each form question represents a distinct piece of information you can collect to help inform your review committee. Each question lives within a section, which groups questions together for your applicants and committee members.

## The Identifier Question

The **Identifier Question** is a special mandatory question that is used to uniquely identify an applicant for your review committee.

You can configure what this means for your committee by changing the Identifier Question's text and description. Some example identifiers include:

- Organization name
- Contact person

<!-- ## Question types

### Short answer
### Paragraph
### Checkboxes
### Multiple choice
### File upload -->

## Create a question

1. On the right-hand toolbar, click **Add Question**.
2. Enter a question prompt for your applicants.
3. Provide additional instructions or context for applicants by filling in an optional description.
4. Indicate whether a response is required by setting the **Required** toggle.
5. Indicate whether the response to this question should remain anonymous for your reviewers by setting the **Anonymize** toggle.

## Question modifications

### Configure the question type

By default, new questions are created as short answer questions. You can change the type of a question to provide a better answering experience for your applicants.

1. Click the box containing **Short Answer** in the top right corner of the question.
2. Select a new question type.

### Different question types

The supported question types within DecisionHub are as follows:

1. Short Answer: good for responses like name, email, and other small pieces of information
2. Paragraphs: good for longer form answers like how an applicant will spend any funding they receive
3. Checkboxes: good for providing options to an applicant in which they can apply to more than one of them
4. Multiple Choice: good for providing options to an applicant in which they only apply to one of them
5. File Upload: good for collecting files from an applicant like a PDF resume or an image

### Validation

Validation is a way to set restrictions on what the applicant can enter into the question. All question types have validation except for Multiple Choice. To access the validations, click the **Show Validation** button on the bottom of the question card.

The validations can be used as follows:

1. Short Answer: setting a word count or character count restriction (both min or max) on the short answer
2. Paragraphs: setting a word count or character count restriction (both min or max) on the paragraph answer
3. Checkboxes: setting a maximum or minimum number of options an applicant can select from the options
4. Multiple Choice: does not apply
5. File Upload: setting the type of file accepted (current options are: pdf, png, jpeg, or any)

### Mapping

Mapping is a cool feature unique to DecisionHub that allows admins to identify a direct 1:1 mapping from a question on this form to a question from a previous form. For example, if I collect the same information every 3 months from my applicants, I can map to the previous forms so applicants have the option on their side to autofill their answers from these previous forms. Applicants will appreciate you being considerate of their time!

Mapping works for all question types. You can only map to a question of the same question type. For a detailed explanation of mapping, please click [here](Collect%20Submissions/Mapping%20Questions).
